# What's been going on?
This document explains the situation of this website. Do not ask me questions about the website without reading through this document first.
## Clearing the Air
Some parts of the site have been taken down. Scroll down to the Resources section to view the remaining utilities.

> Hey, future me here. I realized I wasn't very clear about something. The main reason I took the website down was not the ban. It was the people saying extremely rude things and spreading false rumors after they thought I couldn't see them. I also want to discuss why I was banned. I was banned for apparently breaking the terms of service of Discord, stated by AZMindroma himself. He claims that simply asking somebody for their email and password as a joke broke the Discord terms of service. From what I remember, somebody had done the exact same before in the server, but had not gotten banned. The following was the quoted part of the terms of service in my ban message.<br><br>Among other things, this includes trying to gain access to another user’s account or any non-public portions of the services, infringing anyone else’s intellectual property rights or any other proprietary rights, exploiting, harassing, bullying, spamming, auto-messaging, or auto-dialing people through our services.<br><br>First of all, there was no attempt to gain access to that user's account, and second, they accuse me of exploitation (look it up, no definition matches anything stated in the quoted segment). As far as I know, the message is now deleted, because none of my friends were able to find it. But tons of other people break terms of service on a daily basis, so why am I one of the only two that were banned? Because they still had a grudge on me. See, back when I was still in Rolling Lounge, I used to react the Clown Emoji on people's messages when I thought they say something strange or weren't contributing much to the active conversation. But a few people (of the two that were important, Workspace and AZMindroma). Those two were the only ones that found this annoying, and at that point, I had told them that if they didn't like my reactions on their messages, they could just block me.<br><br><img src="https://github.com/sqdldev/sqdldev.github.io/assets/105597032/d40d7b5f-678d-4cc9-bd73-f6c636f6da19" height="210px"><br><br>A while later, Workspace and I had gotten on slightly better terms and she told me that she did not strike me, which leaves only one person: AZMindroma. He had likely striked me for this "violation" and probably had a bad view of me. Note that literally only 2 of the likely about 20 people I reacted Clown emoji told me that they didn't like the Clown emoji on their message, and I did stop. Basically all of the others found it funny. The staff defended those who did not come forward and tell me they did not like it by saying that they probably were just too scared or didn't want to say it. Bruh. Why are people scared of me? If you didn't want to say it, I won't know.<br><br>Right guys, that's it from future me, back to the original document.

Despite popular belief in Rolling Lounge and many other platforms, I am **not** (bolded because some people cannot read):
 - *what I am described as (source user)*
 - depressed (work)
 - playing victim (work)
 - salty (various users)
 - angry (various users)
 - emotionally damaged (the one who likes mlp)
 - pissed at the fact that I am banned (various users)

Honestly I do not care that I am banned anymore, I had gotten over the few seconds of despair I had experienced.

Some resources had been taken down due to various other reasons that I will not get into, but the resources that are still up will be listed below:

## Resources
This list may be updated, but it is extremely unlikely.

Utilities on this list will not be taken down.

The Tileset, Tile Display Embed, and the Tile Lookup will USUALLY be updated the weekend AFTER an update releases, and the update will be stated below.

    Tileset Latest Update: Top Secret Lab

The SpriteMaker will have new patterns added if Rolling Sky introduces any new patterns to their spritesheets. Fanmade levels do not count.

 - [Tileset](https://sqdldev.github.io/rolling-sky/tileset/)
 - [Tile Display Embed](https://sqdldev.github.io/rolling-sky/tileset/display?tile=1)

## Your Level in WebEditor
Your level is now accessible in the WebEditor page. Please visit [this link](https://sqdldev.github.io/rolling-sky/level-editor/level-recovery/) to recover any level that may have been saved in your LocalStorage. You were warned to regularly back up your level to your device, so consider this as simply a kind gesture from me.
## How do I edit levels now?
I have been asked this question many times in many different ways. You can edit levels in Tiled with the resources in the list and the knowledge that I cannot distribute.

**DO NOT ASK ME HOW TO EDIT LEVELS. YOU SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO ACQUIRE THIS INFORMATION IN ANY WAY FROM ME, NOR WILL YOU HARASS OR SPAM ANYONE ELSE TO ACQUIRE INFORMATION IN ANY WAY.**

If you already know how to edit levels, you will be able to it levels, and if you do not, you will not ask anyone to teach you. This is against the policy that has been set by Cheetah Mobile. The policy is still under effect.
